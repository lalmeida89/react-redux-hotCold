  Hi, I'm Luiz. I'm a recent graduate the Fullstack Development bootcamp at Thinkful. I'm  based out of Brooklyn, New York.

Bio:
  As a youth, I was in charge of all things Tech related at home (mostly turning the router off and then back on). When I was a bit older, I went to college for Civil Engineering and learned that I enjoyed building websites more than I liked building bridges. I'm an avid musician, Magic The Gathering and Lord of the Rings nerd, and I geek out mightly over Fantasy Football stats.
